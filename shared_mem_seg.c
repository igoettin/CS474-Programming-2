Description of program:
    This is our solution to problem 2 of the CS474 Programming #2 Assignment.
    This program will print out values for a shared memory segment using the shmid_ds structure in conjunction with the shmctl() function.
    The values that are printed out include: Segment ID, Key, Mode, Owner UID, Size, and Number of attaches.
